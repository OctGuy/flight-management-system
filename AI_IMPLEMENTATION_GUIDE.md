# AI Flight Management System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive implementation roadmap for the Flight Management System based on the `fms_db.sql` database schema. The system is designed as a modern web application with a Spring Boot backend and React frontend.

## Database Architecture

### Core Database Schema
The system is built around 14 database tables defined in `fms_db.sql`:

#### System Configuration
- **parameter**: System-wide configuration settings (flight durations, booking rules, etc.)

#### User Management
- **account**: Base user accounts with authentication (customers and employees)
- **employee**: Employee-specific data with role types (flight ops, booking, customer service, accounting, admin)
- **customer**: Customer-specific data with loyalty scoring

#### Flight Operations
- **passenger**: Flight passenger information
- **plane**: Aircraft master data
- **airport**: Airport master data with location information
- **ticket_class**: Flight class definitions (Economy, Business, First)
- **flight**: Flight schedule information
- **flight_detail**: Multi-leg flight routing details
- **flight_ticket_class**: Available classes per flight with dynamic pricing

#### Booking & Payment
- **ticket**: Complete booking information with integrated payment tracking

#### Communication
- **chatbox**: Customer-employee chat sessions
- **message**: Chat message history

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… BACKEND - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
The backend is **completely implemented** with all required components:

#### Architecture Layers
1. **Entity Layer**: All 14 entities with proper JPA annotations and relationships
2. **Repository Layer**: Spring Data JPA repositories with custom queries
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic with interface/implementation pattern
4. **Controller Layer**: RESTful APIs for all entities
5. **DTO Layer**: Data transfer objects for clean API contracts
6. **Mapper Layer**: Entity-DTO conversion utilities

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Flight Search**: Complex multi-criteria search with layover support
- **Booking System**: Complete booking flow with payment status tracking
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated payment status management (no external payment gateway)
- **Customer Service**: Full chat system between customers and employees
- **System Configuration**: Dynamic business rule configuration
- **Audit Trail**: Soft delete pattern for data integrity

### ðŸš§ FRONTEND - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
The frontend has core functionality but may need additional features:

#### Implemented Components
- User authentication and registration
- Flight search and booking interface
- Customer dashboard
- Basic admin functionality
- Chat system interface

#### Areas for Enhancement
- Advanced admin dashboards
- Reporting and analytics
- Employee role-specific interfaces
- Enhanced booking management

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Database-Driven Development
The implementation follows a **database-first approach**:
- All entities directly map to database tables
- Business rules are enforced at both database and application levels
- Data integrity maintained through foreign key constraints

### 2. Service-Oriented Architecture
```
Frontend (React) â†” REST API â†” Service Layer â†” Repository Layer â†” Database
```

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
#### Employee Types
1. **Flight Operations (Type 1)**: Flight scheduling and management
2. **Booking/Ticketing (Type 2)**: Ticket sales and booking management
3. **Customer Service (Type 3)**: Customer support and chat management
4. **Accounting (Type 4)**: Financial operations and reporting
5. **System Admin (Type 5)**: System configuration and user management

#### Access Patterns
- **Customers**: Flight search, booking, profile management, chat
- **Employees**: Role-specific operations based on employee_type
- **System**: Configuration via parameter table

## Business Logic Implementation

### Flight Management
```sql
-- Key business rules implemented:
- Minimum flight duration constraints
- Layover duration limits (min/max)
- Advance booking requirements
- Booking hold duration limits
```

### Booking Flow
1. **Search**: Multi-criteria flight search with layover support
2. **Selection**: Choose flight and class with dynamic pricing
3. **Passenger Info**: Capture passenger details
4. **Payment**: Integrated payment status tracking
5. **Confirmation**: Ticket generation with seat assignment

### Payment Processing
- **Status Tracking**: ticket_status (1=paid, 2=unpaid, 3=canceled)
- **Timestamp**: payment_time field for audit trail
- **Integration Ready**: Structure supports external payment gateway integration

### Customer Service
- **Chat System**: Real-time communication between customers and employees
- **Session Management**: Unique chatbox per customer-employee pair
- **Message Types**: Bidirectional communication tracking

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Code Organization
```
backend/src/main/java/com/flightmanagement/
â”œâ”€â”€ entity/          # JPA entities (14 files)
â”œâ”€â”€ dto/             # Data transfer objects
â”œâ”€â”€ repository/      # Data access layer
â”œâ”€â”€ service/         # Business logic layer
â”œâ”€â”€ controller/      # REST API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ mapper/          # Entity-DTO conversion
â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Spring configuration
â””â”€â”€ exception/       # Custom exceptions
```

### 2. API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints following standard conventions
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- DTO pattern for clean API contracts
- Proper HTTP status codes

### 3. Data Integrity
- Soft delete pattern (deleted_at field)
- Foreign key constraints
- Validation at multiple layers
- Transaction management for complex operations

## Testing Strategy

### Current Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer implementations
- **Integration Tests**: Complete booking flow
- **Controller Tests**: REST API endpoints
- **Repository Tests**: Data access operations

### Testing Approach
```
Test Pyramid:
â”œâ”€â”€ Unit Tests (70%) - Business logic testing
â”œâ”€â”€ Integration Tests (20%) - Component interaction
â””â”€â”€ E2E Tests (10%) - Full user journey
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Backend Requirements
- **Java 17+**: Spring Boot application
- **MySQL 8.0+**: Database server
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management

### Frontend Requirements
- **Node.js 18+**: Runtime environment
- **React 18**: Frontend framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Vite**: Build tool

### Production Setup
1. **Database**: MySQL with proper indexing and backup strategy
2. **Application**: Spring Boot with production profiles
3. **Frontend**: Static files served via web server
4. **Security**: HTTPS, CORS configuration, input validation

## Extension Points

### 1. Payment Gateway Integration
The current system has integrated payment status tracking but can be extended with:
- External payment processor integration
- Multiple payment method support
- Refund processing
- Payment notification webhooks

### 2. Notification System
Foundation exists for implementing:
- Email notifications for booking confirmations
- SMS alerts for flight changes
- Push notifications for mobile apps
- Customer communication automation

### 3. Audit Logging
While soft deletes provide basic audit trails, the system can be extended with:
- Detailed operation logging
- User action tracking
- Change history for critical operations
- Compliance reporting

### 4. Analytics and Reporting
The data structure supports advanced analytics:
- Revenue reporting by route/class
- Customer behavior analysis
- Flight utilization metrics
- Employee performance tracking

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Secure password hashing
- Session management

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via JPA
- XSS protection in frontend
- CORS configuration for API access

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on search columns
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization for complex searches
- Pagination for large result sets

### Application Performance
- Service layer caching where appropriate
- Efficient entity-DTO mapping
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Resource optimization

## Conclusion

The Flight Management System is architecturally sound and **production-ready at the backend level**. The database-driven approach ensures data integrity and business rule compliance. The layered architecture provides maintainability and extensibility.

**Current State:**
- âœ… Backend: Fully implemented and tested
